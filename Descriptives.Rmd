# Introduction

In this section we will start with the basics of how to use the LAPOP AmericasBarometer dataset for statistical purposes.
First, we will look at the basics of how to describe a variable using a frequency distribution table and how to graph that variable using pie or bar charts.
For that, we are going to use the latest regional report "The pulse of democracy", available [here](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/ab2021/2021_LAPOP_AmericasBarometer_2021_Pulse_of_Democracy.pdf), where the main findings of the 2018/19 round of the AmericasBarometer are presented.
One of the sections of this document, reports data on social networks and political attitudes.
In this section, data on the use of the internet and the use of social networks are presented, in general and by country.
With the data from the AmericasBarometer, it is possible to know the percentage of households with cell phone access, with internet access, as well as the percentage of people who use WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter.
In this document we are going to reproduce these results.

# About the dataset

The data that we are going to use should be cited as follows: Source: AmericasBarometer by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP), wwww.LapopSurveys.org.
In this document a trimmed dataset is reloaded from scratch.
It is recommended again to clean the Environment of the objects used in previous modules.

This dataset is hosted in the "materials_edu" repository of LAPOP's GitHub account.
Using the library `rio` and the command`import`, this dataset can be imported from this repository.
In addition, the data for countries with codes less than or equal to 35 are selected, it means that observations for the United States and Canada are eliminated.

```{r base18, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rio)
lapop18 = import("https://raw.github.com/lapop-central/materials_edu/main/LAPOP_AB_Merge_2018_v1.0.sav")
lapop18 = subset(lapop18, pais<=35)
```

We also load the 2021 round dataset.

```{r base21}
lapop21 = import("https://raw.github.com/lapop-central/materials_edu/main/lapop21.RData")
lapop21 = subset(lapop21, pais<=35)
```

# Support for democracy

The report The Pulse of Democracy 2021 shows the results for support for democracy by country.
Figure 1.1 shows the percentage of people who support democracy in abstract in each country.

![](Figure1.1.png){width="508"}

In a previous section, we explain how to recode variable ING4, originally measured in a 1-7 scale, where 1 means "Strongly diesagree" and 7 means "Strongly agree".
Values between 5 and 7 are recoded as "1" and this value identifies those who support democracy.
The rest are recoded as "0", those who do not support democracy.
The new recoded variable are saved in a new variable "ing4rec".

```{r recode}
library(car)
lapop21$ing4rec = car::recode(lapop21$ing4, "1:4=0; 5:7=1")
```

In strict sense, this variable is not numeric even though it is defined as "dbl" in the dataset, which is a type of numeric variable.
This variable is qualitative, nominal, that is defined as factor in R.
For correctly defined and labelled, we have to transform this variable.
First, we have to define as factor with the command `as.factor`.

```{r factor}
lapop21$ing4rec = as.factor(lapop21$ing4rec)
```

A factor variable can have levels for each numeric value.
The definition of levels has the goal that tables of figures do not show numeric codes, but the corresponding label.
We can do this using the command `levels`.
Then, we can describe this variable with the command `table` that gives absolute frequencies for each category of this variable.

```{r levels}
levels(lapop21$ing4rec) = c("No", "Yes")
table(lapop21$ing4rec)
```

# Describe variables

As we see in the section Manipulation, we can use the command `prop.table` to obtain relative frequencies and the command `round` to show just one decimal.

```{r round}
round(prop.table(table(lapop21$ing4rec))*100, 1)
```

Results show two categories in the variable "support for democracy".
However, this variable has missing values.
For getting a table showing missing values, we can use the command `table` with the specification `useNA = "always"`.

```{r NAs}
round(prop.table(table(lapop21$ing4rec, useNA = "always"))*100, 1)
```

This table shows that we have 6.4% of missing cases of the total observations.
The presentation of missing values in tables or figures depends of the researcher.

# Plot a variable

We can plot a variable of type "factor" in multiple ways.
A possibility is by a circular graph.
We can use the command `pie`, which is part of the basic syntax of R.
Within this command, we can nest the command `table` to plot values of a contingency table.

```{r pie1}
pie(table(lapop21$ing4rec))
```

This figure has some option to customization.
For example, the specification `labels = …` serves to include the number of observation in each sector, and the specification `col =…` works to define colors of sectors.

```{r pie2}
pie(table(lapop21$ing4rec), labels=table(lapop21$ing4rec), col=1:2)
```

Other option is using a bar plot.
Using the basic command of R, we can use `barplot`.
We nest the commands `table` and `prop.table` within `barplot`.

```{r bar1}
barplot(prop.table(table(lapop21$ing4rec))*100, col=1:2)
```

The base commands in R have a level of customization, but we have a specialized library to produce a graph with more customization options called `ggplot`.
For example, to reproduce a bar plot of the variable support for democracy, we call the library `ggplot2`.

In this example, we have to define the basic specification within the command `ggplot`.
This command works by layers.
First, we specify the data to be used with `data=lapop`.
Then, the specification `aes` defines the aesthetic of the plot.
Generally, it is used to indicate what variables are plotted in what axis (x or y).
In this case, we are working with the data from scratch, from the original dataset "lapop21".
This option obliges to "calculate" the percentages within the specification `aes` with `y =..prop..*100`.
Also, we should use the specification `fill =` to define that bars should present a percentage.

Other easier option is to create before a table from the original data that captures percentages and to use this table in the specification `aes`.
Below, we present examples using this option.

After the specification of data and axis, we have to define the type of plot we want to use.
We do this with geometries ("geom").
We define a basic bar plot using the command `geom_bar( )`, where we define internally the width of bars.
With the specification `labs` we define the labels of axis and the "caption".
Finally, with the specification `coord_cartesian` we define limits for x axis from 0 to 80.

```{r ggbar1}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=lapop21, aes(x=ing4rec))+
  geom_bar(aes(y=..prop..*100, group=1), width=0.5)+
  labs(x="Support for democracy", y="Percentage", 
       caption="AmericasBarometer by LAPOP, 2021")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 80))
```

As we say, this plot presents a bar for the percentage of missing values.
If a researcher would like to present a plot with percentages of valid cases, missing values should be dropped.
We can use the command `subset` again, but within `ggplot` for the command (internally) works with the variable no considering the missing values.
The syntax `!is.na( )` makes the command to not include missing values of a variable in calculations.
If we would have used `!is.na( )` out of `ggplot`, we would have dropped all observations with missing values in the dataset, decreasing the N and affecting next calculations.

```{r ggbar2}
ggplot(data=subset(lapop21, !is.na(ing4rec)), aes(x=ing4rec))+
  geom_bar(aes(y=..prop..*100, group=1), width=0.5)+
  labs(x="Support for democracy", y="Percentage", 
       caption="AmericasBarometer by LAPOP, 2021")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 80))
```

Up to this point, we have presented a bar plot of a single variable, support for democracy, for the whole sample, that includes all countries.
Figure 1.1 shows the percentage of support for democracy by country.
We will see this type of plot in a following section.

# Social media users

Now, we are presenting an example of the report The Pulse of Democracy for the 2018/19 round.
We follow similar procedures as the section above and we will replicate some figures of the report for the 2018/19 round.
We are going to work with these variables: SMEDIA1.
Do you have a Facebook account?;
SMEDIA4.
Do you have a Twitter account?;
SMEDIA7.
Do you have a WhatsApp account?.
These questions have as answer options:

1.  Yes

2.  No

When reading the database in R, this program imports the variables as "num", which most functions in R treat as numeric.
These variables have to be converted to variables of type "factor" with the command `as.factor`, since they are categorical variables.
We save these new variables in the dataframe.
Here we have used the `=` operator which is similar to the `<-` operator that assigns a procedure to a new object of an R dataframe.

```{r factor2}
lapop18$smedia1r = as.factor(lapop18$smedia1)
lapop18$smedia4r = as.factor(lapop18$smedia4)
lapop18$smedia7r = as.factor(lapop18$smedia7)
```

These new variables of type factor have to be labeled with the command `levels`.
A vector with concatenated labels is used, using the command `c( )`.

```{r level2}
levels(lapop18$smedia1r) <- c("Yes", "No")
levels(lapop18$smedia4r) <- c("Yes", "No")
levels(lapop18$smedia7r) <- c("Yes", "No")
```

# Calculating the variables of social network users

As we saw in a previous module, you can calculate new variables with conditional values of other variables using the `ifelse` command.
In this way, we calculate the variables of social network users.

```{r user}
lapop18$fb_user <- ifelse(lapop18$smedia1==1 & lapop18$smedia2<=4, 1, 0)
lapop18$tw_user <- ifelse(lapop18$smedia4==1 & lapop18$smedia5<=4, 1, 0)
lapop18$wa_user <- ifelse(lapop18$smedia7==1 & lapop18$smedia8<=4, 1, 0)
```

# Describing the variables

With the variables ready, we now proceed to make the general tables with the `table` command.
Note the use of `#` as a way of making annotations, which are not R code.

```{r tables}
table(lapop18$smedia1r) #Facebook
table(lapop18$smedia4r) #Twitter
table(lapop18$smedia7r) #Whatsapp
```

This `table` command gives us the absolute frequencies (number of observations) for each category of variables (in this case Yes and No).
To get the relative frequencies, we will use the command `prop.table`, where the previous command `table` is nested.

```{r proportions}
prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia1r))
prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia4r))
prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia7r))
```

However, the command `prop.table` returns us too many decimal places and the relative frequencies on a scale of 0 to 1.
To round this figure we use the `round` command, which allows us to specify the number of decimal places to be displayed.
Both the `table` command and the `prop.table` are nested within this new command.
In this case, we use 3 decimals, so when it is multiplied by 100, it remains in the form of a percentage with 1 decimal place.

```{r table}
round(prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia1r)), 3)*100
round(prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia4r)), 3)*100
round(prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia7r)), 3)*100
```

It is not practical to present 3 tables when the variables have the same response categories.
For presentation purposes it might be better to build a single table.
You can save the partial tables in new objects with the operator `=` and then join them as rows with the command `rbind` in a new dataframe "table" with the command `as.data.frame`, in such a way that the responses to each social network appear in rows.

```{r full table}
Facebook = round(prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia1r)), 3)*100
Twitter = round(prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia4r)), 3)*100
Whatsapp = round(prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia7r)), 3)*100
tabla = as.data.frame(rbind(Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp))
tabla
```

To have a better presentation of the table, you can use the `kable` command from the `knitr` package, using the table built above.

```{r tablamejorada, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
knitr::kable(tabla, format="markdown")
```

# Plotting the variables

In Graph 3.1 of the report it is observed that these data are reported through a pie chart.

![](Figure3.1.png){width="451"}

We can reproduce that graph using the `pie` command which is part of the basic R syntax.
Within this command you can nest the `table` command to graph these values.

```{r pie3}
pie(table(lapop18$smedia1r))
```

You could also think of a bar chart.
Using the basic R commands, you can use the `barplot` command.

```{r bar2}
barplot(prop.table(table(lapop18$smedia1r)))
```

These graphical commands have options to adjust the graph, for example to include percentages and adjust scales.
But, to have more graphical options, we can use the `ggplot` package to reproduce the pie chart.

In this example, we have to define first the data to be used.
The `subset` command has been used again, but inside `ggplot` so that the command (internally) works with the variable but without the missing values.
The `!is.na ()` syntax prevents the command from including missing values of a variable in calculations.
If `data = lapop` had been used the graph would have included a large sector corresponding to the proportion of NA.
If `!is.na ()` had been used outside of `ggplot` creating a new variable, all observations with missing values would have been removed, which would decrease the N, affecting future calculations.

The `ggplot` command works by adding layers.
The `aes` specification is used to define the "aesthetics" of the graph.
It is generally used to indicate which variable is going to be graphed on which axis (x or y).
You can also use the `fill =` specification to define the groups to be generated.

After specifying the data and the axes, you have to specify the type of graph you want to make.
This is done with geometries ("geom").
There is no direct geometry to make a pie chart, so you have to initially use a simple bar chart, using the command `geom_bar ()`, where the width of the bar is defined internally.
If we left the syntax at this point, a bar would be generated that would be divided by the values of the variable "smedia1r".
To generate the pie chart, you have to add another command `coord_polar`, which transforms the bar to polar coordinates, creating a pie chart.

```{r ggpie, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2) #librería especializada en gráficos
ggplot(data=subset(lapop18, !is.na(smedia1r)), aes(x="", fill=smedia1r))+
  geom_bar(width=1) +
  coord_polar("y", start=0)
```

The above graph has started from the same dataframe "lapop18", using the data from "smedia1r".
However, to better manipulate the graph it is easier to create a new dataframe with the aggregated data (frequencies and %).
In other words, save the results data from the "smedia1r" table in a new dataframe.
Then that new dataframe is used to make the pie graph with `ggplot`.

One aspect to note is that in this case the tidyverse is being used, which includes the pipe `%>%` command from the `dplyr` library, which is a (slightly) different way of writing code in R, in a concatenated way, step by step.
A simple explanation of how the pipe is used can be found [here](https://psyr.djnavarro.net/prelude-to-data.html#124_the_pipe,_%%).

The first thing to notice is that a new object called "df" is going to be created.
Information coming from the dataframe "lapop18" will be stored in this object.
The `subset` command is used to remove the missing values of "smedia1r" from the calculation of the percentages.
Then (`%>%`), this data will be grouped by categories of the variable "smedia1r".
Next (`%>%`), in each group the total number of observations is calculated with the command `summarise(n = n())`.
Finally (last step with `%>%`), with this total by groups the percentages are calculated and these percentages are saved in a new column "per".

```{r summarytable, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
df = subset(lapop18, !is.na(smedia1r)) %>%
      group_by(smedia1r) %>% 
      dplyr::summarise(n = n()) %>%
      mutate(per=round(n/sum(n), 3)*100)
df
```

With this syntax, a table is created containing the total number of observations and the percentage for each category of the variable "smedia1r".
A more direct way to create the same data is to use the `janitor` library and the `tabyl` command.
In R there are multiple ways to get to the same results.

```{r summarytable2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(janitor)
subset(lapop18, !is.na(smedia1r)) %>%
  tabyl(smedia1r)
```

Once we have the table, we can use it to produce the pie chart with `ggplot`.
Note that in this case the data used comes from the dataframe df (not from lapop18).
This dataframe has a column called "per" with the respective percentages, which should be plotted on the Y-axis.
As in the previous case, to make the pie chart, we start from the bar chart (hence `geom_bar`), which is then passed to polar coordinates (hence `coord_polar`).

A text layer is added, with the specification `geom_text`.
Within this specification, an "aesthetic" is determined with the data label `aes(label=...)`, where the percentage data "per" and the symbol "%" are joined with the `paste` command, with a space (`sep=...`) between them.
Set the font color with `color="..."`, sets to white to contrast with the colors of the pie chart.
With the command `hjust=...` the horizontal position of this text is adjusted.
The `ggplot` command can include various "themes" for the plot.
In this case, `theme_void()` has been used, which indicates an empty background.
Finally, with the specification `scale_fill_discrete(name=...)` you can change the title of the legend so that it does not show the name of the variable, but a more suitable label.

```{r ggpie2}
ggplot(data=df, aes(x="", y=per, fill=smedia1r))+
  geom_bar(width=1, stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(label=paste(per, "%", sep="")), color="white",
            position=position_stack(vjust=0.5), size=3)+
  coord_polar("y")+
  theme_void()+
  scale_fill_discrete(name="Do you have a Facebook account?")
```

If instead of a pie chart you want to display a bar chart, with the data from the "lapop18" dataframe you can use the following code.
Unlike the first pie chart, the `aes(..)` specification now includes the variable "smedia1r" as the variable to be plotted on the X-axis.
Inside the geometric object `geom_bar()` it is indicated that the bar must represent the proportions in percentages `aes(y=..prop..*100, group=1)`.
In this example, a general label for the graph and for the axes has been included with the `labs(...)` command.
In this command you can also add a "caption" to indicate the source of the data.
Finally, the specification `coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,60))` limits the Y axis to values between 0 and 60.

```{r ggbar3}
ggplot(data=subset(lapop18, !is.na(smedia1r)), aes(x=smedia1r))+
  geom_bar(aes(y=..prop..*100, group=1), width=0.5)+
  labs(title="Do you have a Facebook account?", x="Facebook user", y="Percentage", caption="AmericasBarometer by LAPOP, 2018/19")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 60))
```

In this case you can also use the grouped data of the "df" dataframe.
Unlike the previous option, in "df" there is the percentage data, so it should not be calculated in the code, so in the aesthetics specification it indicates that the alternatives should be shown on the X axis of the variable "smedia1r" and on the Y axis the percentage, in this way `aes(x=media1r, y=per)`.
For this reason also in the `geom_bar` specification, now instead of requiring the calculation of the percentage, it is only indicated to replicate the data (with `stat="identity"`) from `aes`.
Finally, in this case we add the text layer to include the percentages in each column, with the `geom_text` specification.

```{r }
ggplot(df, aes(x=smedia1r, y=per))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",  width=0.5)+
  geom_text(aes(label=paste(per, "%", sep="")), color="black", vjust=-0.5)+
  labs(title="Do you have a Facebook account?", x="Facebook user", y="Percentage", caption="AmericasBarometer by LAPOP, 2018/19")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 60))
```

We consider this option a easier way to work with this data.
First, we have to create a dataframe with the percentages and the labels.
Then, we have to use this dataframe in `ggplot`.
In the following sections, we will use this way.

# Summary

In this document we have worked with nominal categorical variables, such as whether or not you suppport democracy or whether or not you use social networks.
We present several ways to describe these variables in frequency tables and to plot these variables, using circular or bar graphs.

# Calculations including design effect

The results for the 2018/19 wave are not exactly the same as those in the report, since LAPOP includes the effect of the sample design in its calculations.
According to this syntax, it is found that 57.1% of interviewees report being a Facebook user, when 56.2% appear in the report.
The same with Twitter, which here is calculated at 8.8% and in the report 7.9%; and with WhatsApp that appears here with 64.6% and in the report with 64.4%.
As indicated in the section on the use of survey weights using data from the AmericasBarometer (available [here](https://arturomaldonado.github.io/BarometroEdu_Web_Eng/Expansion.html)), there are several ways to reproduce the results by incorporating the survey weights.
A first option is to use the command `freq`, which allows the inclusion of a weighting variable, such as "weight1500".
The `plot=F` specification is included to not produce the bar graphs.

```{r weighted descriptive}
library(descr)
descr::freq(lapop18$fb_user, lapop18$weight1500, plot = F)
descr::freq(lapop18$tw_user, lapop18$weight1500, plot = F)
descr::freq(lapop18$wa_user, lapop18$weight1500, plot = F)
```

Without considering the survey weights, 57.1% of the interviewees have a Facebook account.
This percentage varies to 55.2% if the expansion variable is included, which is the value shown in the report.
These weighted results can also be saved to objects and then graphed in the same way as the unweighted results.

In the case of Facebook, the table can be saved as a dataframe, using the command `as.data.frame`.
This table includes data that we do not require, such as the NA's and Total row and the Percent column.
These rows and this column are deleted using the specification `[-c(3,4), -2]`.

The columns are then renamed to avoid the "Valid Percent" name.
They are simply named "freq" and "per".
This column "per" is the one that has the data that we will graph.
Finally, a "lab" column is added with the labels of each row of results.

```{r table fb}
fb <- as.data.frame(descr::freq(lapop18$fb_user, lapop18$weight1500, plot = F))
fb = fb[-c(3,4), -2]
colnames(fb) = c("freq", "per")
fb$lab = c("No", "Yes")
fb
```

With this new dataframe we can replicate the same codes used above to make a bar chart or a pie chart.
The following code displays the bar chart.
Note that now the "fb" dataframe is used and that in aes it is specified that the data from the "lab" column must be on the X axis and the data from the "per" column must be on the Y axis.

```{r weighted bars}
ggplot(data=fb, aes(x=lab, y=per))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",  width=0.5)+
  geom_text(aes(label=paste(round(per, 1), "%", sep="")), color="black", vjust=-0.5)+
  labs(title="Do you have a Facebook account?", x="Facebook user", 
       y="Percentage", caption="AmericasBarometer by LAPOP, 2018/19")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 60))
```

The same can be done to create a pie chart.
This graph reproduces the results found in Graph 3.1 of the report.

```{r weighted pie}
ggplot(data=fb, aes(x=2, y=per, fill=lab))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(label=paste(round(per, 1), "%", sep="")), color="white", 
            position=position_stack(vjust=0.5), size=3)+
  coord_polar("y")+
  theme_void()+
  labs(caption="AméricasBarometer by LAPOP, 2018/19")+
  scale_fill_discrete(name="Do you have a Facebook account?")+
  xlim(0.5, 2.5)
```

The second option to reproduce the results in the report is using the package `survey`.
As we indicate in this [section](https://arturomaldonado.github.io/BarometroEdu_Web_Eng/Expansion.html), we have to define first the sample design with the command `svydesign`.

```{r survey}
library(survey)
lapop.design = svydesign(ids = ~upm, strata = ~estratopri, weights = ~weight1500, nest=TRUE, data=lapop18)
```

Once you have created the data with the expansion factor in the "lapop.design" object, you can use the native commands of the package `survey` to perform calculations.
For example, to calculate the frequency distribution table you can use the `svytable` command.

```{r svytable}
svytable(~fb_user, design=lapop.design)
```

These frequencies can be nested in the `prop.table` command to calculate the percentages of social network users.
These results are the same as those shown in the previous graphs and those that appear in the report.

These data can also be saved in a dataframe that is adapted for graphing, following the same procedure as in the previous graphs.

```{r svytable prop}
prop.table(svytable(~fb_user, design=lapop.design))
prop.table(svytable(~tw_user, design=lapop.design))
prop.table(svytable(~wa_user, design=lapop.design))
```
